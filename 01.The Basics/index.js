// Console Log
// 💬 Output "Hello World" to the console
// console.log(`Hello World`);

// 💬 Output "I Like Figma" to the console
// console.log(`I Like Figma`);

// Alert Boxes
// 🚨 Display an alert box with the message "This is an Alert!"
// window.alert(`This is an Alert!`);

// 🚨 Display an alert box with the message "I Like Framer"
// window.alert(`I Like Framer`);

// Change Text Content in HTML
// ✏️ Select the HTML element with ID "myHeading" and set its text content to "Hello World"
document.getElementById("myHeading").textContent = `Hello World`;

// ✏️ Select the HTML element with ID "myParagraph" and set its text content to "I Like Figma"
document.getElementById("myParagraph").textContent = `I Like Figma`;

// 🧠 Simple Analogy 🧠
// 🎬 Think of JavaScript as the "director" of a play.
// 🎭 Just like a director tells actors what to say and do on stage, JavaScript tells the web browser what to display and how to respond to user actions.
// 📋 `console.log` is like the director giving instructions behind the scenes, telling you what's happening.
// 📢 `window.alert` is like the director calling out important notes to the audience or actors.
// 📜 Changing text content in HTML is like setting the script lines for the actors, so they know what to say to the audience.

// 🎯 Possible Use Cases:
// 1️⃣ Debugging 🛠️: Use `console.log` to output values or messages for debugging purposes (e.g., checking variable values or confirming code execution).
// 2️⃣ User Notifications 🚨: Use `window.alert` to display simple messages or notifications to users (e.g., alerting users of important information or errors).
// 3️⃣ Dynamic Content Update ✨: Change the text content of HTML elements dynamically based on user interactions or other events (e.g., updating headings, paragraphs, or other text elements on a webpage).
// 4️⃣ Code Documentation 📝: Use comments to document code or provide explanations (e.g., adding single-line or multi-line comments to describe code functionality or leave notes for future reference).
// 5️⃣ Interactive Elements 🖱️: Use `getElementById` to access and manipulate specific HTML elements based on their IDs (e.g., changing the style or content of elements when a button is clicked).
// 6️⃣ Form Validation ✅: Access form fields and validate user inputs before submission (e.g., checking if required fields are filled out correctly).
// 7️⃣ User Feedback 📣: Display or update feedback messages based on user actions (e.g., showing success or error messages in response to form submissions).
// 8️⃣ Real-Time Updates 📈: Use `getElementById` to reflect real-time changes in the user interface (e.g., updating live scores or stock prices).
// 9️⃣ Event Handling 🎨: Attach event listeners to HTML elements and update their content or styles based on user interactions (e.g., changing background color on hover).
// 🔟 Data Display 📊: Use `console.log` to output data for analysis or visualization (e.g., logging API responses or computed values for review).

// 🎯 Possible Use Cases of JavaScript in Web Development:
// 1️⃣ Interactivity 🖱️: Enhance user experience by adding interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and animations (e.g., handling button clicks, validating form inputs, and creating dynamic content updates).
// 2️⃣ DOM Manipulation 🔄: Dynamically modify the structure and content of web pages using the Document Object Model (DOM) (e.g., updating text, changing styles, or adding/removing elements based on user actions).
// 3️⃣ AJAX Requests 🌐: Communicate with servers asynchronously to fetch or send data without reloading the page (e.g., updating content with new data from APIs or submitting form data in the background).
// 4️⃣ Event Handling ⌨️: Respond to user interactions and other events (e.g., managing mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and form submissions to trigger specific actions).
// 5️⃣ Form Validation ✅: Ensure that user inputs meet required criteria before submission (e.g., checking if fields are filled out correctly or if values follow specific formats).
// 6️⃣ Dynamic Content ✨: Generate and update content on the fly based on user input or other conditions (e.g., displaying real-time data, updating content based on user choices, or creating interactive UI elements).
// 7️⃣ Client-Side Storage 💾: Store data locally in the user's browser for later use (e.g., using Local Storage or Session Storage to save user preferences or session information).
// 8️⃣ Responsive Design 📱: Enhance the responsiveness of web pages with JavaScript (e.g., adjusting layout and styles based on screen size or device orientation).
// 9️⃣ Animation 🎬: Create engaging animations and transitions to improve visual appeal and user experience (e.g., animating elements or transitioning between states).
// 🔟 Data Visualization 📊: Generate charts, graphs, and other visual representations of data to provide insights and enhance user engagement (e.g., using libraries like Chart.js).
