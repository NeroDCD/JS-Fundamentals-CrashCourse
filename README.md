## Status
Completed (80/80)

This repository documents my learning journey with JavaScript while following the **“JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners”** series by Bro Code.  
The goal was to build a solid foundation in JavaScript and understand how the language works.

Topics covered include:
- Variables  
- Data Types  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Event Handling  
- And more

Instead of just watching the videos, I experimented with and modified the examples to reinforce what I learned.  
Each file includes notes and brief explanations for clarity.
