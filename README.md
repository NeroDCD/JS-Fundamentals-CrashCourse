## üíª Introduction

- This repository documents my learning journey with JavaScript while following the **‚ÄúJavaScript Tutorial for Beginners‚Äù** series by Bro Code.  
- The goal was to build a solid foundation in JavaScript and understand how the language works.
- Instead of just watching the videos, I experimented with and modified the examples to reinforce what I learned.  
- Each file includes notes and brief explanations for clarity.
