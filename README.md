This repository is a compilation of my JavaScript learning outputs. The project was developed following the "JavaScript tutorial for beginners 🌐" `by Bro Code`. This course is a combination of individual videos from the JavaScript playlist. I will attempt to finish some parts of the tutorial daily, steadily building my skills and understanding of JavaScript


**Note:** As part of my learning journey, I have implemented, modified, and added various components and styles to explore and solidify my understanding of JavaScript.

These changes were made to enhance my understanding and improve the overall design of the project.
