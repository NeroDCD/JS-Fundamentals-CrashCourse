This repository represents an ongoing effort to compile my JavaScript learning outcomes. The project is based on the "JavaScript tutorial for beginners 🌐" by `Bro Code`. I plan to complete portions of the tutorial daily, progressively enhancing my JavaScript skills and knowledge.


**Note:** As part of my learning journey, I have implemented, modified, and added various components and styles to explore and solidify my understanding of JavaScript.

These changes were made to enhance my understanding and improve the overall design of the project.
