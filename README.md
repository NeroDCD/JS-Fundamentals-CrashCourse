This repo is where I’m keeping track of everything I’m learning about JavaScript as I follow the "JavaScript tutorial for beginners 🌐" by Bro Code. The goal is to learn the basics of JavaScript and get comfortable with how it works.

I’m working through the tutorial daily, learning about stuff like variables, data types, loops, functions, and event handling. As I go, I’m not just following the videos but also tweaking the examples and playing around with the code to get a better feel for how things work. 🔧✨

I’m focusing on understanding the core concepts and applying them directly through coding. As I go through the tutorial, I’m experimenting with the examples to see how things work in practice. The main goal is to get a strong grasp of the basics and use that as a stepping stone for more advanced topics like JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

I’ll keep updating this as I go and share what I’m learning along the way! 🎨🔍
