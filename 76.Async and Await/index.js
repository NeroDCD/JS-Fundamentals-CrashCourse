// 76. JavaScript ASYNC/AWAIT is easy

// 🌟 Async/Await = A way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
// 🚀 Async = A keyword that makes a function return a Promise automatically.
// ⏳ Await = A keyword that makes an async function wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing execution.
// ✍️ This allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner, improving readability.

// 📜 Note: Async functions do not have `resolve` or `reject` parameters like traditional Promises.
// 📜 Everything after the `await` keyword is placed in an event queue, ensuring it executes after the Promise is settled.
