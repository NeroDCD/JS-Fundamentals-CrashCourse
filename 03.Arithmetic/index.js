// 03. JavaScript ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

// 🔢 Arithmetic Operators = Operands (Values, Variables, etc.) + Operators (+, -, *, /)
// Example: 11 = x + 5;

// Basic Arithmetic Operations
// let students = 30;

// ➕ Increment by 1
// students = students + 1;

// ➖ Decrement by 1
// students = students - 1;

// ✖️ Double the value
// students = students * 2;

// ➗ Divide by 3
// students = students / 3;

// 📈 Exponents (e.g., students raised to the power of 3)
// students = students ** 3;

// 🔢 Modulus (Gives the remainder of division)
// let ExtraStudents = students % 3;
// console.log(ExtraStudents); // Logs the remainder after division

// Augmented Assignment Operators
// ➕ Adds 31 to students
// students += 31;

// ➖ Subtracts 20 from students
// students -= 20;

// ✖️ Multiplies students by 4
// students *= 4;

// ➗ Divides students by 2
// students /= 2;

// 📈 Raises students to the power of 2
// students **= 2;

// 🔢 Finds the remainder when students is divided by 2
// students %= 2;

// Increment/Decrement Operators
// ➕ Increments students by 1
// students++;

// ➖ Decrements students by 1
// students--;

// Operator Precedence (from left to right)
// 1. Parentheses () ➡️ Highest precedence
// 2. Exponents **
// 3. Multiplication ✖️, Division ➗, Modulo 🔢
// 4. Addition ➕, Subtraction ➖

// Example of operator precedence
let result = (12 % 2) + 8 / 2;  // 🔢 Modulus and division are performed before addition
// Displays the result in an HTML element with ID "result"
document.getElementById("result").textContent = result;

// 🧠 Simple Analogy 🧠
// Think of arithmetic operations as tools in a toolbox 🔧: 
// ➕ Addition is like a wrench that joins two pieces together, increasing the total. 
// ➖ Subtraction is like a saw that cuts away part of something, reducing the total. 
// ✖️ Multiplication is like a machine that makes multiple copies of an item, increasing the total in a big way. 
// ➗ Division is like splitting a large cake into equal slices, reducing the total into smaller parts. 
// 🛠️ Just as you use different tools for different tasks, you use these arithmetic operations 
// to perform various calculations in JavaScript.

// 🎯 Possible Use Cases:
// 1️⃣ Calculating Values ➕➖✖️➗: Perform basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for 
// various applications (e.g., calculating totals, averages, or discounts).
// 2️⃣ Updating Values 🔼🔽: Use increment and decrement operators to adjust values efficiently (e.g., updating counters or tracking progress).
// 3️⃣ Handling Remainders 🔢: Use modulus to determine remainders or to handle scenarios like pagination 
// (e.g., finding the remainder of division for a list of items).
// 4️⃣ Applying Augmented Assignments ➕= ➖= ✖️= ➗=: Simplify updates to variables with augmented assignment operators
//  (e.g., adjusting totals or applying changes based on user interactions).
// 5️⃣ Managing Complex Expressions 🧮: Use parentheses and operator precedence to handle complex calculations accurately
//  (e.g., combining multiple arithmetic operations in formulas).
// 6️⃣ Converting Units 🌍: Apply arithmetic to convert units of measurement (e.g., converting miles to kilometers).
// 7️⃣ Calculating Percentages 📊: Determine percentages for financial calculations, grades, or statistics (e.g., finding 20% of a value).
// 8️⃣ Budgeting and Financial Planning 💵: Compute expenses, savings, and investments (e.g., calculating interest rates or loan repayments).
// 9️⃣ Time Calculations ⏳: Perform operations on time values (e.g., calculating the difference between two dates).
// 🔟 Resource Allocation 📈: Use arithmetic to distribute resources, such as dividing tasks among team members or allocating budget across departments.
