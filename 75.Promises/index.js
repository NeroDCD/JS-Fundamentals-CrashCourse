// 75. What are JavaScript PROMISES?

// 🔄 Promise = An object that manages asynchronous operations.
// 📦 It wraps around asynchronous code to handle its execution, providing a result at a future time.
// 📝 A Promise can either be resolved (successful) or rejected (failure).
// 📌 Syntax: `let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { /* asynchronous code */ });`
// 🔧 The `resolve()` function is called when the operation is successful, passing the result.
// ⚠️ The `reject()` function is called when the operation fails, passing an error message.
// 🚀 Promises make it easier to handle asynchronous operations without falling into nested callbacks.
